comparing elements in 2 arrays which have common and uncommon elements
array1 {2,3,20,55,10}
array2 {21,22,2,3,10,32}

position 0 of array 1 will be compared with every position in array 2

check if array 1 and array 2 have a common element or dont have a common element

first element of array 1 is getting compared with all the elements in array2


create a outer for loop and an inner for loop
get the size of the array
iterate the outer loop with i to array1.length
    iterate the inner loop with j to array2.length
        compare the i iteration position to all the array2.length positions
            if common elements then do something.
